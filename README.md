# Web Calculator
I decided to work more on front-end now since I realized I'm not really that good back-end. So I decided to make a web calculator. It's pretty basic and not that accurate, as it doesn't follow PEMDAS, so don't actually use this.

This was a fun little project I made to extend my skills of HTML, CSS and TypeScript. You can visit the website at https://theawesomestnathan.github.io/web-calculator/
